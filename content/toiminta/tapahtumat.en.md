# Jyväsmetro

Jyväsmetro is an annual event hosted by Linkki, held during May day celebrations. During the event students tour bars in Jyväskylä and its surrounding areas via buses, which serve as a sort of metro system, thus giving the event its name. Sometimes, the buses are named after sponsors of the event. Essentially, it's like a traditional pub crawl, but instead of walking, participants travel by bus.

For more information go to Jyväsmetro's own [homepage](https://jyvasmetro.fi/).

# Instanssi

Instanssi is a yearly festival of digital making organized by Linkki and [Hacklab Jyväskylä](https://jyväskylä.hacklab.fi/). The first Instanssi was held in 2010.

Instanssi is a beginner-friendly event that anyone interested in digital culture can visit and enjoy. Instanssi offers demoscene compos (competitions), workshops, presentations, and a friendly creative environment.

More information can be found on Instanssi's own [homepage](https://instanssi.org/).

# Boardgame Evenings

Linkki arranges evenings to play boardgames together about once a month. These evenings regularly are on the first Monday of the month at Agora. Linkki has a decent boardgame selection on hand, however you are welcome to bring your own games. You can also show up and leave as you please during the evening.
