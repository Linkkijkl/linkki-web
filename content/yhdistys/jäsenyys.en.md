Joining a student association usually leads to lifelong friendships and to student culture that looks like its members. As a member of **LINKKI** you get to take part in various events, excursions, and activities.

Linkki has three kinds of memberships:

- *Regular member*: Regular members are students of Mathematical Information Technology, Education Technology, or Computer Science.
- *Supporting member*: Supporting members are natural persons who support the cause and activities of the association.
