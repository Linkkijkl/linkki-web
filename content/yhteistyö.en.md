# Types of Collaboration

### Company Visits

Company visits, known among students as excursions, provide companies with
a great opportunity to showcase their operations and facilities, as well
as themselves as employers. During these visits, students get an opportunity
to genuinely know the companies and their employees.

### Student Overalls

Linkki's overall colors are a bit different from the usual monochrome ones;
Linkki members' overalls are blue and black. These overalls are worn at
almost all student events, making overall advertisements an excellent way
to gain visibility among students beyond just those studying information
technology. Overall advertising is one of our most popular collaboration
methods.

### Events

Another type of collaboration is participating in Linkki's events, for
example, by having your own booth at [Instanssi](https://instanssi.org).
Linkki's members are active event-goers, so company visibility is definetly
ensured.

### Annual Gala Support

In keeping with tradition, **Linkki Jyväskylä ry** celebrates the past year
with a prestigious annual gala. Participants inclue everyone from our
freshmen to alumni, partners and invited guests. Spporting the annual
gala is a great way to beacome familliar with many of the attendees. We
also offer the opportunity to speak to guest on site. More information
can be found from [vujut.linkkijkl.fi](https://vujut.linkkijkl.fi) or

### Instanssi Support

[Instanssi](https://instanssi.org), a digital creation event organized
annually by **Linkki Jyväskylä ry**, is a low barrier of entry event for
anyone interested in IT, programming and other digital creating. Companies
