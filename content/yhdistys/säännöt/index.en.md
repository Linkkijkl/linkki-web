Unfortunately we don't have the resources to translate all our rules and guides
from Finnish, while also making sure no content gets lost in translation. Other
than the alredy translated information in this page, the best we can provide is
a [link to google translate](https://linkkijkl-fi.translate.goog/yhdistys/s%C3%A4%C3%A4nn%C3%B6t/?_x_tr_sl=fi&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
and the best of hopes in understanding it.
