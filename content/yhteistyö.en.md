# TYPES OF COOPERATION

## Company visits

Company visits, known among students as excursions, provide companies with a great opportunity 
to showcase their operations and facilities, as well as themselves as employers. During these 
visits, students get an opportunity to genuinely know the companies and their employees. A lot 
of our members get employed during their studies.

## Student overalls

Student overalls are a student's uniform. They are worn at almost all student events, so the overall advertisements are a great way to be seen by other computer science students. Linkki's overall colour is slightly different from other student associations, as Linkki's overalls are blue-black. The overall ad is one of our most popular forms of collaboration.

## Events

One form of collaboration is participation in Linkkis events. Linkeens are active event participants, so visibility of your company is guaranteed.

### Jyväsmetro

Jyväsmetro is the biggest event organized by Linkki, as well as one of the biggest student events in Jyväskylä. The event is interdisciplinary by nature, so your company will be visible to other students outside of Linkki. For more information about the event please visit the Jyväsmetro [website](https://jyvasmetro.fi/en/).

### Instanssi

Instanssi is an annual demo party event held in Jyväskylä and organized by **Linkki Jyväskylä ry**. It's a low-threshold event for everyone interested in IT and programming. Your company can support the event financially, as well as by participating as a speaker, workshop leader or by presenting about your company. More info on their [website](https://instanssi.org/).

### Annual Gala

Linkki Jyväskylä ry celebrates its past year with an annual gala. Participants include everyone from freshers to alumni, partners as well as invited guests. 
Supporting the annual gala is a great way to introduce your company to attendees.

Next year will be the 20th anniversary of our student association, so we 
intend to have a bigger gala than usual. We are therefore looking for 
supporters. For more information please visit our annual gala [website](https://vujut.linkkijkl.fi) or send us an email tapahtuma@linkkijkl.fi.

## Linkki sticker

Companies can collaborate with Linkki by offering benefits from their products 
or services. By presenting a Linkki sticker, our members are entitled to pre-agreed benefits.

## Other Forms of Collaboration

Our methods for collaboration are not limited to those listed above; we are always 
ready to develop new collaboration methods. If you have a new form of collaboration 
in mind, we are ready to develop it further together. Please send a message 
to yritys@linkkijkl.fi.
