## Chat rules

This chat is intended for dealing with matters related to studies and
our student association. However, the conversation does not have to be
strictly related to these, and more free time related topics are welcome
as well. **Respect others while messaging.** Especially forbidden behaviour
include:

- Threatening behaviour and hate speech

- Junk mail and advertising

**Linkki Jyväskylä ry**:s chat is moderated by the current board of
directors and moderators named by it. Individual moderation
desicions can't be appealed.
