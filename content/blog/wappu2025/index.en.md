## 28.4. Vappu sitsfest

Vappu is already just around the corner, which means it's time for Magna 
and Linkki to have a Wappu-sitsfest together. This sitsfest's theme is
topsy-turvy, so some things might be in a different order
than usual. Wouldn't it be silly, if a sitsfest began with Finlandia
instead of Helan Går? Or if everyone was wearing their clothes incorrectly?

Join Magna and Linkki in this ludicrous sitsfest on 28.4. at 17-21 o'clock
in Tilia, located within the T-building in the Seminaarinmäki area.

This event is BYOB (bring your own beverage) and BYOF (bring your own 
food), so please remember to bring your personal beverages and foods.
A personal shot glass is also strongly advised, for use with potential
half-time alcohol-free shots. Tilia has no possibility to use a microwave 
oven, so prepare to bring yourself foods that do not need separate heating.
It is possible to also run a shopping trip, or order food.

Ticket sales begin Tue 15.4. at 12 o'clock and end Tue 22.4. at 23.55.
Ticket price is 2,00€ and includes two alcohol-free shots.
