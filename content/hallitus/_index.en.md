A **board of directors** is chosen for a year at a time in the organisation's autumn meeting, where all members of the organisation are invited to vote. Board members do not differ from other members beside their obligation to fulfill operations required by law and the operative plan of the organisation. In Linkki, members acting in administrative roles or as directors of teams are members of the board.

**Operatives** are members of the organisation's teams, commonly tasked with a specific role within said team. Operatives have no legal responsibility or obligations within the organisation. If you would like to participate in Linkki's operations, send a freely formed email to pj@linkkijkl.fi and we will fit you right in!

**Teams** are legs of the organisation, where the operative tasks of the organisation are performed. These tasks are laid out by law, and the organisations operative plan.
