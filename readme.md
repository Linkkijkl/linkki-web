# Linkki-web

Repository of [linkkijkl.fi](https://linkkijkl.fi).


## Getting started

First:

1. Install git and [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com)
2. Clone this repository, i.e. `git clone https://github.com/linkkijkl/linkki-web`
3. Initialize git submodules `git submodule init && git submodule update`

After this there are a few options:

1. Use Devcontainers (easiest if you have Docker already installed)
    - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and [Devcontainers VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
    - Open this repository in VSCode and there should be a popup asking if you want to reopen the project in a container. Do that.
    - When inside a container, open a terminal inside VSCode (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`, search for `create new terminal`) and run `hugo server`.

2. Install Hugo locally
    - Install [Hugo extended edition](https://gohugo.io/)
    - Run `hugo server` and you should be good to go ðŸŽ‰
    - Or optionally, on some supported Unix based environments _(currently MacOS, Debian and Fedora)_, you can just run `startup.sh`.

3. Use [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
    - This approach won't require you to have anything but a modern browser installed, not even this repository cloned. Please note that our association has a limited time of Codespace usage per month, so if you plan to do anything more complex than content updates, the former options are recommended over this one.
    - You can open it from here:

    - Please remember to close your codespaces when you're done!
