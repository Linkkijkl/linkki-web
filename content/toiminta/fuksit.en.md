Warm welcome to Jyväskylä!
Aside official guides and this page you can familiarize yourself
with [an alternative study guide for STEM
students](https://www.jyu.fi/fi/file/vopas2025pdf), known as VOpas.
This document is sadly written entirely in Finnish.

> "VOpas is perhaps the most significant – in any case most successful
> book, that Jyväskylän University's STEM faculty has ever published.
> Even though it contains encertainties, old-fashionednesses and
> full-on contradictions, it has provided an irreplaceable aid in new
> students' lives, who are thrown amidst higher education while while
> fumbling the very threads of their lives."

## In the beginning

Your studies will begin in late August with a roll call in
[Agora](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/87950403).
The week following this is the so-called orientation week
filled with JYU's, as well as student organistions' activities
specifically to assimilate you into the world of academia.

## What student association?

Student associations are organisations comprised of each science's students, advocate for [student's rights](https://www.jyu.fi/en/for-students/instructions-for-bachelors-and-masters-students/new-student-handbook/students-rights-and-responsibilities), organise various
culture, worklife and recreational events as well as work to improve the field of study's communality and employment.

Linkki Jyväskylä ry (better known as Linkki) is the very own
advocacy and recreational association for Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral students, who are studying
Computer Science, Mathematical Information Technology and Education Technology in any capacity. Joining Linkki is free of charge, and joining provides you access to advocacy, events, [discounts from our partners](/en/benefits/).
with the Linkki-sticker, as well as free coffee in [kattila](/kattila/).
The link to the application form can be found on [the front page](/).
