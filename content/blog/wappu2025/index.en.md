✨SAVE THE DATE(S)!✨

It's exactly four weeks to the start of the vappu festivities, so here we go again! 🎉 This year, linkeens don't have to think about what to do, because our events team has made sure there's plenty to do.

Grab the dates from the post and make sure you're on the Linkki's announcement channel, as more details about events and registrations will be posted there in the coming days.

As in the past, you can get your Linkki's vappu overall patch by attending six (6) Linkki's vappu events. The distribution of the vappu pass will be announced later.

Stay tuned and see you at the events!🫶🏻🥳
